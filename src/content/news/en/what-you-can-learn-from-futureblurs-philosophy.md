Successful communities need successful mindsets. Today, you'll learn what this looks like at Futureblur and how it can be applied to your life. Ultimately, you'll know just enough to piece together the meaning of "Create, Polish, Repeat".

## "Start with an incredible idea."

Ideas are these magical things that seemingly appear out of nowhere. They are a complex result of consistent thinking, gathering inspiration, and having dreams. And interestingly enough, the more you chase them, the more they seem to run away. At the start of every journey, there is always one big idea. A spark of hope and fuel for motivation to keep going. However, ideas are fluid and dynamic — they evolve, and so do you. That means, before starting a project next time, pause for a moment to determine how valuable it is.

## "Don't be afraid to reach for the stars."

"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” by Norman Vincent Peale sums up this section pretty well.

## "The first step is all about creating the prototype."

You have to start working backward from the final vision, which involves creating a simple, yet effective prototype. At this stage, you should not worry about looks, because a great product needs functional design.

## "Next up is polishing, where most of the time will be spent."

Polishing means working on something over and over, until happy with the results (see below). You improve by constantly iterating.

## "Embrace the countless hours, because deep down we know it's worth it."

Do not be worried about roadblocks or think about stopping. The time invested is not time wasted, because all of that experience will come in handy at some point later. To continue through hard times, you will need to have trust. A process without trust is a journey destined to fail.

## "Once happy with the results, repeat as often as needed."

Notice how we didn't define "happy". Since you are the creator of the journey, you are in control of deciding when the finish line has been crossed — after which the process starts over again. We do not stop inventing, growing, or helping as long as the globe keeps spinning.

## "The journey isn't an easy one for sure, but that's exactly what makes it so special."

Throughout this cycle, you will most likely encounter many challenges. That could be anything from lack of social media growth, and software bugs to something as simple as motivation. In these difficult times, a good rule of thumb is to remember why you started in the first place.

## "So rewarding. So uplifting. So beautiful."

And this is exactly why you started in the first place. Nothing beats this sense of accomplishment. Here, we want to evoke peace and contentedness.

So, what will *you* create?
