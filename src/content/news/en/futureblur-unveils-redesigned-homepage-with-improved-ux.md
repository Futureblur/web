Futureblur today introduced its heavily redesigned homepage, offering a modern, intuitive user experience, and expanded resources. Built on the reliable [Astro framework](https://astro.build), the updated site incorporates sleek design elements, simplified navigation, and enhanced accessibility — all while maintaining the core identity of Futureblur. The homepage now includes localized content, a refined legal section, and several new pages designed to support both users and partners.

## Expanded localization and smart language detection  
The Futureblur homepage now features fully localized content for German-speaking users. An intelligent language detection system has been integrated to prompt a language switch based on browser preferences, ensuring a seamless experience for users around the world. While German is the first supported language, additional language support is under consideration for future updates.

When visiting a page in a language different from the browser's settings, a header appears above the navigation bar, suggesting a switch to the localized version of the site. This feature is designed with privacy in mind, as it does not track the user’s location or store cookies. It relies solely on the browser’s language preferences. If preferred, the banner can be dismissed by clicking the button on the right, and our site will remember this choice for future visits, preventing the suggestion from reappearing unless local browser cache has been cleared.

*With a single tap, users can switch to a page in their native language.*
## Reimagined from the ground up
In line with Futureblur's commitment to creating a welcoming user experience, the redesigned homepage introduces a light mode aesthetic. Monospaced fonts for headers and footers on a soft off-white background help to achieve an industrial, yet warm feel. The use of subtle animations enhances the scrolling experience, adding a refined touch without detracting from usability. As part of this transition, dark mode is no longer available.

## Streamlined legal pages and new resources  
The new update simplifies Futureblur's legal and policy sections. The privacy policy has been revised, removing outdated references to cookie tracking services, such as [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), and improving clarity across all documents. Legal pages have been optimized for screen readers, ensuring accessibility for all users. Additionally, the redesigned site now includes an expanded set of pages, such as a sitemap, brand guidelines and press page, cookie policy, and a new contact page.

## Continuity with familiar foundations  
Despite the major redesign, Futureblur has retained its core framework, continuing to use Astro as the static site generator. All existing links remain functional, ensuring a smooth transition for users. The site's branding remains consistent, keeping the same identity that users have come to know.

The redesigned homepage is live now, with automatic redirection from the previous version to ensure users experience the latest updates. Futureblur will continue to evolve, with plans to expand language support and introduce additional features in future updates.
