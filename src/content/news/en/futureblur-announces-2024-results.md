2024 has been an extraordinary year for Futureblur. What began as small side-project has transformed into a thriving brand with a growing global community. And looking back, Q2 was one of our best performing fiscal quarters of the year. The numbers speak for themselves: Futureblur is not just a brand — it’s more than that.

The key to this success was our yearly event, [Create Infinites](https://fut.red/SvNo9), a significant milestone in our journey. During that event, we brought together some of the most underrated creators on the planet and gave them eight weeks to supercharge their growth. To say that we have achieved that goal would be a [major understatement, to say the least](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9md9PNopSm/?igsh=bHd5b2phNzh1Y2dq).

And the launch of [Blender Essentials](https://store.futureblur.com), our flagship product, set an all-time record with a total of 743 sales. To this date, it remains as our best-selling product we’ve ever made.
