Today marks a significant milestone in our ongoing mission to support and elevate the world’s most underrated talent. In a [special virtual event](https://fut.red/SvNo9), we announced several exciting developments that will help artists achieve their dreams faster than ever before.

Futureblur's community has seen remarkable growth over the past three months, now sitting at over 19,000 followers. This achievement is a testament to the dedication and passion of our members. In February, we launched [Blender Essentials](https://store.futureblur.com/l/ble), a virtual guide designed to kickstart the journey with Blender. Since its release, it has been downloaded over 300 times, setting an all-time record for the best product we've ever shipped.

## Pro editing techniques

The first segment featured invaluable tips and tricks specifically tailored for creating compelling reels. For example, a tutorial on the highly requested [glitch effect](https://fut.red/k7yrY) was demonstrated. Then, we showed a step-by-step guide on optimizing video exports. Key tips included applying the 'Unsharp Mask' effect, using the H.264 format, and adjusting bitrate settings for the best possible results.

*Premiere Pro still remains one of the best choices for video editing.*

## Meta's new policies

Then, we talked about unexciting AI news. Starting on June 26, 2024, Meta plans to use content shared on their platforms to train its artificial intelligence models. Luckily, there is a way to [opt out](https://fut.red/HcjbF).

## Let the viral weeks begin

And lastly, our highlight of the show. To kick off Create Infinities, we defined the core of creativity, which is inspiration. Coming across inspiration can be hard, due to the addictive nature of social media platforms. The key is to make a clear distinction of consuming and creating. In other words, it's highly unlikely to find entertainment and inspiration in a single feed.

So, it's recommended to train the feed of one account to suggest relevant content. This can be done by giving clear signals whenever you come across a reel that sparks your interest: liking, sharing or replaying are just one of many interactions that help Instagram understand your preferences better. Most importantly, these reels should be saved to a custom collection that can be accessed later.

*A rock-solid framework to consistently find inspiration. It's surprisingly easy.*

## Moving onward

We have exciting weeks ahead of us, and this was only the beginning. Expect more tutorials, guides and helpful resources throughout the event on Futureblur's YouTube channel. To participate alongside other artists, join the [Futureblur community](https://fut.red/d) for free.
