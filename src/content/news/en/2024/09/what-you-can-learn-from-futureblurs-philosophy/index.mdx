Successful communities need successful mindsets. Today, you'll learn what this looks like at Futureblur and how it can be applied to your own life. At the end, you'll know just enough to piece together the meaning of "Create, Polish, Repeat".

## "Start with an incredible idea."

Ideas are these magical things that seemingly appear out of nowhere. They are a complex result of consistent thinking, gathering inspiration and having dreams. And interestingly enough, the more you chase them, the more they run away.

At the start of every journey, there is always one big idea. It's a spark of hope and fuel for motivation to keep going. What you need to realize though is that ideas are fluid and dynamic — they evolve over time, with you. So, before starting a project next time, pause for a moment determine how valuable it is.

## "Don't be afraid to reach for the stars."

 "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” by Norman Vincent Peale sums up this section pretty well.

## "The first step is all about creating the prototype."

You have to start working backwards from the final vision, which involves creating a simple, yet effective prototype to begin with. At this stage, you should not worry about looks, because a great product needs functional design.

## "Next up is polishing, where most of the time will be spent."

Polishing means to work on something over and over again, until happy with the results (see below). You improve by constantly interating.

## "Embrace the countless hours, because deep down we know it's worth it."

Do not be worried roadblocks or think about stopping. The time invested is not time wasted, because all of that experience will come in handy at some point. In order to continue through hard times, you will need to have trust. A process without trust is a journey destined to fail. 

## "Once happy with the results, repeat as often as needed."

Notice how we didn't define "happy". Since you are the creator of the journey, you are in control of deciding when the finish line has been crossed. Once that milestone has been reached, the process starts over again. We do not stop inventing, growing or helping as long as the globe keeps spinning.

## "The journey isn't an easy one for sure, but that's exactly what makes it so special."

Throughout this cycle, you will most likely encounter many challenges. This could be anything from social media growth, software bugs to something as simple as motivation. In these difficult times, a good rule of thumb is to remember why you started in the first place.

## "So rewarding. So uplifting. So beautiful."

And this is exactly why you started in the first place. Nothing beats this sense of accomplishment. Here, we want to evoke peace and contentedness.

So, what will *you* create?
